#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

The bigger the input, the longer the function takes.


b) O(n)

The bigger the input, the longer the function takes.


c) O(log n)

Bigger input takes longer but it's faster than O(n)

## Exercise II

Loop from the first floor to n and throw it from each one. If the egg breaks, the current floor is f.

O(n) complexity.
