#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

The bigger the input, the longer the function takes.


b) O(n^2)

Because it loops and calculates twice.


c) O(log n)

Bigger input takes longer but it's faster than O(n)

## Exercise II

Go to the middle floor, drop an egg, and if it breaks, go halfway more down. If it doesn't, go halfway more up. Repeat until there is only 1 floor remaining.

O(log n) complexity.
